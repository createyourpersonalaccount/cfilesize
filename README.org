** TODO Add ~install()~ commands for CPack to work correctly

** TODO Modify the preset workflows to have debug, release, etc, specified

Fix them so that debug, release, default, and so on are meaningful. Maybe add ~package~.

** TODO Do I need to remove -Linux from CPack archives?

Use ~CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME~ for this. Shouldn't the package be portable?

** TODO Fix Doxygen

Is it generating documentation?

** TODO Include large files

** DONE Fix symbolic links
CLOSED: [2024-12-14 Sat 00:17]

If a file is symbolic then ~stat()~ does not resolve it; the file size is the symbolic link path size.

** TODO Replace CMake platform logic with CPP logic
